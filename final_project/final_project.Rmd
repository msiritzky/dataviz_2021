#Note: there may be a more succinct way to udpate your covid_data df without needing to individually select(), gather(), group(), summarize(), and then full_join() it. Becuase of my own unfamiliarity with your approach using the gather() function, I didn't dig too far into condensing this for you. Also, there may not be a more efficient way to do it; I'm unsure.

#The colors can be a bit difficult to differentiate here between countries; I might switch them up to appear more different. Also, you could change the color of the confidence interval to be a lighter hue that matches each line. I'm not sure if the legend provides additional information since each graph is labeled separately.
